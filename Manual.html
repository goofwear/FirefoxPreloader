<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a little program for people who use Mozilla Firefox on older machines. It is designed to pre-load Firefox in the background so it will load faster when requested.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Mozilla Firefox 1.0 or better</li>
	<li>4MB plus Enough memory to run Firefox</li>
	<li>Window 95 or NT 4.0 or better</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Once you have downloaded the installation program, simply run this program and it will guide you through installing the Firefox Preloader.  If you are running an older version, it is recommended that you unload it or you will have you restart your computer when the installation finishes.</p>
<p>The first time the pre-loader runs, it may ask you for the directory that Firefox is installed in if it was unable to automatically find Firefox.  You may change this later if you wish.</p>
<h2>Using the Preloader</h2>
<p>To use the Firefox Preloader, simply place a shortcut in the Windows StartUp folder, if one is not present.  To begin using if right away, simply use the shortcut in the Windows Start Menu under the Firefox Preloader program group.</p>
<p>When the Preloader is loaded, a Firefox icon will appear in the system tray.  By right-clicking on the icon, you can bring up a menu of actions to control Firefox and the Preloader.  By double-clicking on the icon, you can open a new Firefox window with your currently set home page(s).</p>
<p>The Firefox Preloader will immediately load a portion of Mozilla Firefox into memory to cut the startup time of Firefox in half.  As you begin to use Firefox the remaining portions will be loaded into memory.  When all of the Firefox Windows are closed, Firefox will remain in memory and the next startup will be instantaneous.</p>
<p>If you use the &lsquo;File-&gt;Exit&rsquo; menu item in any Firefox browser windows, Firefox will be unloaded and all the memory it was using freed.  The Preloader will then reload Firefox, making it available for later use.</p>
<h2>Installing and Removing Themes and Extensions</h2>
<p>Since the Firefox Preloader will keep Firefox loaded, even when no Firefox windows are visible, installing or removing themes and extensions may not take affect as expected.  Since Firefox must be restarted to remove or install a theme or extension, you must terminate Firefox using either of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the &lsquo;File-&gt;Exit&rsquo; menu item in any Firefox windows.</li>
	<li>Use the &ldquo;Reload Firefox&rdquo; menu item in the Preloader's tray icon menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you plan to work or/develop a theme or extension, the Preloader can easily get in the way be requiring the extra effort to terminate Firefox.  To make sure that Firefox always unloads when you close all Firefox windows, you can deactivate the Preloader by using the &ldquo;Unload Firefox&rdquo; menu item from tray icon menu.  You can make the Preloader resume its normal function by using the &ldquo;Reload Firefox&rdquo; menu item in the tray icon menu.</p>
<h2>Using the Preloader Menu</h2>
<p>Right clicking on the Firefox icon in the tray will present the following menu items:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Open My Homepage</strong> - Opens your current home page in a new browser window</li>
	<li><strong>Internet Options</strong> - Opens the preferences window to set Firefox's options</li>
	<li><strong>Preloader Options</strong> - Opens the dialog where you set the Firefox path and other options the pre-loader needs</li>
	<li><strong>Reload Firefox</strong> - Unloads (if pre-loaded) and reloads Firefox to clean Firefox's memory cache, enable newly installed extensions, and use a newly applied theme.  This also reactivates the Preloader if it was deactivated.</li>
	<li><strong>Unload Firefox</strong> - Unloads Firefox and deactivates the Preloader to free memory for other applications, use &ldquo;Reload Firefox&rdquo; to reactivate the Preloader and load Firefox into memory.  This options is disabled when the Preloader is inactive.</li>
	<li><strong>About Firefox Preloader</strong> - Displays the current version of the Firefox Preloader installed</li>
	<li><strong>Unload Firefox Preloade</strong>r - Unloads the Firefox Preloader and any instances of Firefox loaded by the Preloader</li>
</ul>
